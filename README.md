**Setting Up Your Assignment**

When starting each assignment, you’ll follow the same basic steps.

Click the instructor-provided invite link. If you don’t have a GitHub account you’ll be prompted to create one.
After signing in, accept the permissions for GitHub Classroom. You should only need to do this once.
Next, click Accept this assignment.
You’ll need to choose your ND user name from the list. You should only have to do this once. If you can’t find your ID or run into problems, just click Skip and contact the TA.
GitHub Classroom will set up your personal assignment repo. The landing page will give you a link to access it.
Finally, clone the repo.

**Cloning Your Assignment Repo**

After setting up your assignment repo on the website, it’s time to clone it locally and start working. You can clone via either HTTPS or SSH. (If you don’t know what this means, use HTTPS.)

You’ll need to use your own assignment URL of course. At this point, you’re ready to start working. Use git add to stage your changes and then git commit to record the state of the repo. It’s recommended that you commit early and often so you can look at the history, roll back changes, and so on.

After you’ve made some commits locally, you can push your code to GitHub. The assignment repo works the same as a normal repo on GitHub. When it comes time to push your code, you’ll need to specify the branch and remote explicitly.

for example, git push origin main

You should visit the web page for this assignment repo to see your commits, just to be sure that everything is correctly pushed to GitHub. Keep pushing code as you work, and at the deadline the commit on the master branch on GitHub will be captured.
